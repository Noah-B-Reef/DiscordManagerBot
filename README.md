# Discord Manager Bot (Manager 1.0)
Thank you for checking out my Discord Server Manager Bot. If you haven't already the invite link is: https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=915840986125565962&permissions=8&scope=bot. This project is a Discord bot that is able to automate certain tasks,
such as muting a user, and bring added functionalities, such as serving up memes from Reddit, making this bot a great addition
to any Discord server. Below is a list of commands to help get you started with understanding the bot.
(Note by default the starting prefix is '!' for a commands)

Commands:

!meme - pulls up a random meme from the 'memes' sub-Reddit

!setprefix {newprefix} - makes {newprefix} the new command prefix for the server

!quiz - plays a quiz game with the user in which it asks 10 True/False questions

!filter - Toggles profanity filter (set to 'ON' by default)

!mute @{user} {time} - mutes {user} for alotted {time} in seconds
  - It is important to specify the 'muted' roles permissions in each text/voice channel's settings for the restricted perms for those channels (AKA "Can't send messages")

!rulesetup - creates a 'rules' embed for your server

These are all the commands/functionalities thus far for the bot, more may be added in the future.

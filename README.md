# Discord Manager Bot
Thank you for checking out my Discord Server Manager Bot. This project is a Discord bot that is able to automate certain tasks,
such as muting a user, and bring added functionalities, such as serving up memes from Reddit, making this bot a great addition
to any Discord server. Below is a list of commands to help get you started with understanding the bot.
(Note by default the starting prefix is '!' for a commands)

Commands:

!meme - pulls up a random meme from the 'memes' sub-Reddit

!setprefix {newprefix} - makes {newprefix} the new command prefix for the server

!quiz - plays a quiz game with the user in which it asks 10 True/False questions

!filter - Toggles profanity filter (set to 'ON' by default)

!mute @{user} {time} - mutes {user} for alotted {time} in seconds

!rulesetup - creates a 'rules' embed for your server

These are all the commands/functionalities thus far for the bot, more may be added in the future.
